# Movie-Recommendation-System

Wondered how Google comes up with movies that are similar to the ones you like? Inspired to learn about it I have build two recommendation systems for myself.

It turns out that there are (mostly) three ways to build a recommendation engine:
1. Popularity based recommendation engine
2. Content based recommendation engine
3. Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine

Here I have implemented the latter two systems as the first one is the simplest kind of recommendation engine that anyone will come across. The trending list we see in YouTube or Netflix is based on this algorithm. It keeps a track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views in descending order(highest view count to lowest view count). Pretty simple but, effective.
